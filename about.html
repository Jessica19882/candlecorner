      We are a company that loves candles and wax melts, not only for scent
      purposes but for the many ways in which candles bring joy and comfort into
      people's lives! <br>
      Candles are used all over for many different purposes,
      whether it be for celebrations and customs, at bath time to distress, for
      parties and events, for gift giving, for comfort in hard times, and so
      much more! <br>
      Each candle is hand crafted with you in mind! We want our
      passion for candles to light up your life as well! ​<b>​ NOTE from
      owner/maker:</b> <br>
      "I want to personally customize a candle or pack of melts
      or both for you or anyone you may be gifting to! I want to know your
      likes, ideas and preferences as I will put a personal touch into each one!
      Feel free to use the chat/email sections provided to let me know if you
      want something specific made outside of what you see on the website and I
      will do my best to create! <br>
       I believe that my candles are unique because a
      piece of who you are goes into each one! <br>
      Thank you for visiting Candle
      Corner!" -Tara

    <center><h3>How Our Candles Are Made:</h3></center>

    <div class="para">
      ​Each of our candles and our wax melts are made by hand. <br> We use a white beeswax mix for a
      slow burn! <br>
      With this type of wax, you will see little to no smoke! <br>
      White beeswax also holds the essential oils in very well so you get the best scent throw possible!
      <br>
      <hr>
      Each candle is customized and designed with various essential (non toxic)
      oils, real dried flowers and glitter. Flowers and glitter are always optional of course!
      <br>
      <hr>
      The products are made using a double boiler, mixing tools, beakers and
      thermometers to ensure each candle is poured at and is cooling at the
      correct temperatures! <br>
      <hr>
      Most candles are a 2 day pour to avoid sinking of
      your candle! We use various molds for the wax melts!
      <br>
      We are always learning and innovating so our candle and wax melt styles
      are often changing!
      <hr>
      Just be assured that we always continue to put the
      same level of care into all that we do!
      <br>
      Whether candles will be shipped or picked up locally, we find packaging to
      be of the upmost importance in order for your candle to arrive undamaged!
